                                Partial Status is when we partially refund the remains of an order. Sometimes for
                                some reasons we are unable to deliver a full order, so we refund you the remaining
                                undelivered amount. Example: You bought an order with quantity 10 000 and charges
                                10$, let's say we delivered 9 000 and the remaining 1 000 we couldn't deliver, then
                                we will "Partial" the order and refund you the remaining 1000 (1$ in this example.

                                Drip Feed is a service that we are offering so you would be able to put the same
                                order multiple times automatically. Example: let's say you want to get 1000 likes on
                                your Instagram Post but you want to get 100 likes each 30 minutes, you will put
                                Link: Your Post Link Quantity: 100 Runs: 10 (as you want to run this order 10 times,
                                if you want to get 2000 likes, you will run it 20 times, etc…) Interval: 30 (because
                                you want to get 100 likes on your post each 30 minutes, if you want each hour, you
                                will put 60 because the time is in minutes) P.S: Never order more quantity than the
                                maximum which is written on the service name (Quantity x Runs), Example if the
                                service's max is 4000, you don’t put Quantity: 500 and Run: 10, because total
                                quantity will be 500x10 = 5000 which is bigger than the service max (4000). Also
                                never put the Interval below the actual start time (some services need 60 minutes to
                                start, don’t put Interval less than the service start time or it will cause a fail
                                in your order </div>

                                plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes
                                control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
                                transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default
                                variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
                                accordion-body though the transition does limit overflow. </div>
